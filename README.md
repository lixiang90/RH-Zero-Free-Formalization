# RH-Zero-Free-Formalization

Lean companion to the RH-Weil project's best zero-free-boundary derivation.
Author of this formalization: **Li Xiang / lixiang90**.

The boundary is
$$
\sigma_* = \frac{11}{12}-\frac{e_*}{4}
          =0.874957019420098946\ldots,
\qquad 657e_*^3-954e_*^2+21e_*+20=0,
$$
with the unique root strictly isolated by
$$
\frac{16683858898627}{10^{14}}<e_*<
\frac{16683858898628}{10^{14}}.
$$

**Proof status:** the exact boundary, continuous algebraic certificate,
parameter feedback, ordered height closure and the concrete zeta inverse
Mellin signal are formalized. The separate arithmetic development now checks the complete low-kappa energy
induction, terminal certificate, finite-row energy bridges, slot construction,
moving parameters and local Euler corrections. The complete physical probe and its
low/raw-high estimates remain open. The sharpest zeta theorem
has an explicit `ZetaInverse.ArithmeticProbeObligation` hypothesis;
an unconditional Lean proof of the improved zero-free region is still pending.

The [main paper](papers/kappa-feedback-cubic-boundary-paper.pdf) derives the
strict half-plane Re(s) > sigmaStar for finite-order Hecke functions over
Q(sqrt(-3)), followed by Dirichlet functions and zeta, **relative to its stated
imported analytic package**. Principal poles are allowed and the boundary
line is excluded. The new code preserves those distinctions.

## What the kernel checks

| Module | Content |
|---|---|
| [Boundary](ZeroFree/Boundary.lean) | Root existence by the intermediate value theorem, uniqueness, strict rational isolation, and exact improvement over 7/8, 69999/80000 and the free-b boundary. |
| [Certificate](ZeroFree/Certificate.lean) | Every coefficient identity modulo the cubic, positive coefficients in the real embedding, square completion, and the continuous reference inequality. |
| [Geometry](ZeroFree/Geometry.lean) | Positive margins and ring identities for physical ranges, Gram gaps, slot supply, Euler boxes and the auxiliary buffer. |
| [Feedback](ZeroFree/Feedback.lean) | Exact finite count differences, their bound by a parameter increment divided by 50, the derived physical slope, and the 359 Delta/400 strict saving. |
| [Continuation](ZeroFree/Continuation.lean) | Actual Mellin convergence, analyticity, the identity theorem and nonvanishing; ported from OpenAI/math with provenance. |
| [Signal](ZeroFree/Signal.lean) | Variable-boundary low/high signal combination and conditional specialization to Mathlib's actual riemannZeta. |
| [Family](ZeroFree/Family.lean) | A uniform-margin family contradiction without assuming the zero supremum is attained. |
| [HeightClosure](ZeroFree/HeightClosure.lean) | Choose the height exponent before the tail order, collapse raw high estimates, and retain a family-wide positive saving. |
| [ZetaConcrete](ZeroFree/ZetaConcrete.lean) | Prove boundedness of actual zeta zero real parts and entire pole removal with the proved residue at one. |
| [ZetaInverse](ZeroFree/ZetaInverse.lean) | Construct the actual Gaussian inverse Mellin signal; prove the reciprocal bound, local integrability and arbitrary power decay at zero. |
| [ZetaSignal](ZeroFree/ZetaSignal.lean) | Derive the Mellin product identity and reduce the zeta theorem to arithmetic correction/probe estimates. |
| [PlainComparison](ZeroFree/PlainComparison.lean) | Check repaired scalar reflected/clipping budgets at kappa >= 37/50; the separate arithmetic capsule also checks the actual terminal induction. |
| [SourceScaling](ZeroFree/SourceScaling.lean) | Normalize the actual complex powers at variable slot length and scale imbalance; match the paper exponent and the constructed zeta amplitude while preserving the intrinsic Mellin pole 1/6. |
| [Main](ZeroFree/Main.lean) | Connection of the cubic certificate to the rational count, buffer admission, and the explicitly conditional best-boundary zeta theorem. |

Lean proves every coefficient identity and real inequality using ordinary
kernel-checked proofs. The historical Python audit is outside the proof trust
boundary. The continuous assertion covers every y >= 0 and every real delta
in the cleared quadratic; the endpoint conclusion uses its stated rectangle.

An axiom audit of a conditional theorem checks the implication with its
hypotheses. It does not prove those hypotheses. The open input and
paper-to-code mapping are in [proof-status.md](docs/proof-status.md).

## Reproduce the verification

- Lean: `leanprover/lean4:v4.33.0-rc2`
- Mathlib: `51e6992efd06126df61a496bebf8f49482a4e129`
- All dependency revisions: [lake-manifest.json](lake-manifest.json)

From a fresh checkout with Elan and Python 3.10+:

```sh
lake update
lake exe cache get
python scripts/verify.py
```

The script builds the entire library and freshly prints the transitive axioms
of every public theorem. It rejects placeholders, custom axioms and unchecked
computational proof methods. Permitted foundational axioms are
`propext`, `Quot.sound`, and `Classical.choice`.

The complete library build and fresh audit of **224 public theorems passed**,
with only the three foundational axioms above. Source-bound results and logs
are in [lean-verification.json](verification/lean-verification.json).
A fresh **serial independent Nano replay passed 58,126 declarations** from all
224 public roots. Commands, input hashes and permitted-axiom output are in
[independent-kernel.json](verification/independent-kernel.json).
Both checks retain the explicit analytic hypotheses described above.

## Papers and sources

The [papers directory](papers/README.md) contains byte-identical TeX/PDF copies
of the cubic paper and its two predecessors. Delivery hashes are retained in
[paper-provenance.json](verification/paper-provenance.json).
[RH-Weil](https://github.com/lixiang90/RH-Weil) continues to hold papers and
research history. The separate
[zero-proportion formalization](https://github.com/lixiang90/RH-Zero-Proportion-Formalization)
concerns critical-line proportions.

The paper cites OpenAI/math revision `adc7f124...`; generic analytic modules
were ported from the separately inspected revision `fd4aeeb2...`.
Exact hashes, modifications, licenses and scope are in the
[upstream audit](docs/upstream-audit.md). The full upstream seven-eighths
proof was inspected statically; this repository has not compiled or
kernel-certified that complete proof. The actual low-kappa source extension
is compiled separately with its original toolchain; its current proof status
and repaired margins are described in [plain-kappa-extension.md](docs/plain-kappa-extension.md).
The [arithmetic capsule](upstream/plain-kappa/README.md) separately records
actual Lean 4.34.1 compilation, fresh complete types/axioms and independent
replays for all **89 selected roots in 28 authored modules**: slot construction,
moving parameters, Euler correction, principal comparison/normalization,
Gram-factor scales, the ray-prime normalizer, conditional Dirichlet/zeta
transfer, actual finite-row energy interfaces, arbitrary-total source Batch
construction, the finite-fiber height-loss budget, actual moving-kappa marked
admission and an eventual marked bound for a fixed finite source family.
The native terminal degree is also proved uniform before all characters and
ideals. For fixed slots, the terminal/profile degrees and positive common
height ceiling can be fixed before every finite character/ideal family; its
constant and scale threshold precede all admitted smaller height exponents.
A separate four-root replay
checks the complete patched low-kappa induction and its terminal output.
The complete marked-moment and physical-probe proof remains open.
The [finite-row integration note](docs/finite-row-energy-integration.zh.md)
explains the constructed NaturalState, exact fiber dictionary and height budget.
The imported PNTA source contains two original placeholders; neither occurs
in the selected exports. This separate scope is not added to the primary
224-theorem count.
